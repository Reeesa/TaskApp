# Task App

An UNFINISHED to-do app that chooses a small number of daily tasks for you, to help you get things done without overwhelming you with chores. You choose the categories of your life that you want to be more organized or collected. The app chooses a small selection of tasks for you to do each day to improve the quality of that category. eg) If you choose clean-house as a category you might get one of the following as a day task: vacuum, empty the sink, do your laundry, declutter your living room, etc. Impress your friends with how put-together you seem while still having hours a day to play video games or browse the internet!
